## The task
I'll show you the contents of a{file_extension} file. Please list all classes and interfaces that are implemented in this file, and for each class or interface please provide:
{field_descriptions}

## Sealed classes and interfaces, or enums
For sealed classes and interfaces please list all the defined sub-classes and for each explain how each one is being used in other classes and what effect does it cause as a summary of the original sealed class or interface.
For enums in summary please list all values and explain how each is being used in other classes and what effect does it cause.

Examples for class:
```
sealed class ExampleState {{
    object ExampleState01: ExampleState
    data class ExampleState02(val content: String): ExampleState
}}
```

Good example (sub-classes explained in the summary, explaining the effects):
```
{{
      "simple_classname": "ExampleState",
      "full_classname": "com.example.mosconiremoteandroid.data.ExampleState",
      "summary": "ExampleState is a sealed interface that defines the possible states for some example. ExampleState01 causes the ViewModel to show example1, ExampleState02 causes the ViewModel to show example2",
      "category": "Data",
      "methods": [],
      "variables": []
    }},
```
Wrong example (sub-classes defined as separate classes, explaining only the name):
```
{{
      "simple_classname": "ExampleState",
      "full_classname": "com.example.ExampleState",
      "summary": "ExampleState is a sealed interface that defines the possible states for some example.",
      "category": "Data",
      "methods": [],
      "variables": []
    }},
    {{
      "simple_classname": "ExampleState01",
      "full_classname": "com.example.ExampleState.ExampleState01",
      "summary": "ExampleState01 is a first state of ExampleState",
      "category": "Data",
      "methods": [],
      "variables": []
    }},
    {{
      "simple_classname": "ExampleState02",
      "full_classname": "com.example.ExampleState.ExampleState02",
      "summary": "ExampleState02 is a second state of ExampleState",
      "category": "Data",
      "methods": [],
      "variables": []
    }},
```
