Now the first step:
1. Gather initial knowledge - get knowledge from knowlege store to find classes and files that are relevant to the task.
                                   
Project description:
{project_context}

The search documents look like this:

Example 1 a class summary for `com.example.topic.TopicViewModel.Factory`:
"Factory interface for creating TopicViewModel instances with the required topicId parameter. It is used by Hilt to inject the ViewModel with the appropriate topic ID when the Topic screen is displayed.
Used in features:
ViewModel Dependency Injection
Topic-Specific Data Handling
Hilt Integration
Example questions:
How does the app ensure that the correct TopicViewModel is instantiated for each specific topic ID?
What role does the Factory interface play in the ViewModel creation process within the app's architecture?
How does the assisted factory pattern help in managing dependencies for the TopicViewModel?
File with implementation: `com/example/topic/TopicViewModelFactory.kt`"

Example 2 individual class property summary for `followableTopics` property in `com.example.news.UserNewsResource`:
"Property `followableTopics` of a `UserNewsResource` class: List of topics associated with the news resource, each indicating if the user is following them.
Used in features:
Bookmarks and saved content
Topic following and filtering
Personalized news feeds
File with implementation: `com/example/news/UserNewsResource.kt`"

Example 3 individual class method summary for `userData` property in `com.example.user.UserDataRepository`:
"Method `userData` of a `UserDataRepository`: Provides a Flow that emits the current user data.
Used in features:
User personalization and theme settings
Content bookmarking and viewing tracking
Topic following and notifications
File with implementation: `com/example/user/UserDataRepository.kt`"

Avoid overly specific code terms unless the query is about code implementation.

Vector Similarity Search: Focus on semantic intent with natural language senctences or questions. Use full sentences. Use it to find general knowledge which files/classes/properties/methods are responsible for a given topic.
BM25 Search: Focus on exact keywords from features, code names, descriptions. Use this if you want to ask for a particular classname or a property/method.

Please provide:
- Refined user task, keep all the details (translate to english if needed).
- Check if the task needs splitting into smaller search areas, provide search queries for each area. Required one or more.
- queries for vector similarity search and bm25 search (max 3 for each type) to find relevant code files (english only), for each area.
