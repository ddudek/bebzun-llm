Steps 1 and 2 are completed.

Project description:
{project_context}

Search Results:
{search_results}

Now the third step:
3. Summarize results and finish the process

Based on the user's task and the provided results, identify if this is the full implementation and prepare final answer.

Please provide either:

If opened files in the memory do not give full implementation to understand the user task, please return Option1:
Option1: "Get more information": Open more files and/or search knowledge for summaries.

If opened files in the memory give a complete implementation and understanding of the user task (including details in related classes), please return Option2:
Option2: "Finish summary": with code snippets quoted from the code files (do not provide your own code snippets).

Instructions how to format your output:
Option1: "Get more information":
Please provide:
- files_to_open: Additinal files to open, provide a list of "File with implementation". Leave empty list if not needed.
- additional_search_queries: Search queries with semantic intent with natural language questions to find more class summaries.
- classes_not_related: List of classes that are completely not related to the user task.
- finish_summary: empty.

Option2: "Finish summary"
Please provide:
- files_to_open: Empty list, e.g. "[]"
- additional_search_queries: Empty list, e.g. "[]"
- finish_summary: Your summary of the given files about the user task. Explain why is this enough to finish the task. Include code snippets quoted from the code files (do not provide your own code snippets).
- classes_not_related: List of classes in memory that are completely not related to the user task (important!).

User task: "{user_task}"
